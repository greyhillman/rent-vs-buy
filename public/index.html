            <h1>Rent or Buy?</h1>
            <p>
                While I was deciding on whether to rent or buy, I was confused
                about all the variables that go into the decision. The common
                advice is to buy because
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <q
                        >You're investing your money into something that always
                        goes up</q
                    >
                </li>
                <li><q>It's a safe investment</q></li>
                <li>
                    <q
                        >You're putting money into yourself and not someone
                        else</q
                    >
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I wasn't convinced as I knew my investments into index-based
                stocks and bonds also, in the long-run, always go up. I wanted
                some numbers to convince not just myself but others who kept
                nagging me about it.
            </p>
            <p>Most of the calculators I've seen have been either</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    based on false assumptions, like staying at 1 rental the
                    entire time, or
                </li>
                <li>
                    unclear on what the variables are for and how they're used
                    (is this monthly? yearly? why a percentage and not a dollar
                    amount?).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>That's why I've created this calculator.</p>
            <aside class="info inline">
                I've made this calculator primarily for myself. I'll try and
                keep it general but there's no guarantees.
