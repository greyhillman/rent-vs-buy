# rent-vs-buy

An interactive site for deciding on whether to rent or buy a place.

## Background

The other calculators I've seen rely on assumptions that I don't think are true. For example,

1. When renting, you'll stay at the same place the entire time.
2. Your income stays the same.

## Other Calculators

A non-exhaustive list of other calculators I've come across:
